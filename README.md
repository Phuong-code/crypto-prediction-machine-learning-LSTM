# crypto-prediction-machine-learning-LSTM
 
This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict cryptocurrency prices using historical data. In this example, we'll be predicting the prices of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), but you can adapt the code to work with other cryptocurrencies as well.

**Disclaimer:** This project is intended for educational and learning purposes only. It should not be used for making real financial decisions. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and predictions may not be accurate.
